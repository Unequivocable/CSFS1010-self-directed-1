Self Directed assignment 1 for CSFS1010


"Open Sans" from Google Fonts - regular and bold

a 1100px wide wrapper or container (this doesn't absolutely need to be 1100px, maybe you want to work with percentages...) Have fun with it!

a full bleed background colour (#d5d5d5).

an overlay on hover of images (hint: try using a "to bottom right" linear gradient and percentages to get the triangle look!).

font awesome icons in the footer, make sure these are links. Don't forget to include the "visually-hidden" class to make sure these links are accessible. They should also have a hover state, it could be a colour change or something else, or a combination.
